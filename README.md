# Simple Pet Adoption Website

## Project Overview
Welcome to my Simple Pet Adoption Website, a project designed using modern web technologies to facilitate the adoption process of various pets. This website dynamically displays pets like dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds, fetching their detailed information from an open API.

### Built With
- **JavaScript (JS)**: For handling API requests and dynamic content rendering.
- **JSON (API)**: Used for retrieving pet data from an open source.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend components efficiently.
- **DaisyUI**: Integrated with Tailwind for utilizing prebuilt UI components.

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Data Retrieval**: Fetch and display data from a JSON API, ensuring fresh and accurate information.
2. **Modal Pop-ups**: Use modals for detailed information on each pet, providing a better user experience.
3. **Sorting Functionality**: Ability to sort pets by price in descending order.
4. **Loading Spinner**: Enhances user interface during data loading when switching between categories.
5. **Data Persistence**: Temporarily store data in a div to prevent excessive API calls.

## ES6 Features
This project utilizes several ES6 features to write cleaner and more efficient code:
- `let` and `const` for block-scoped variable declaration.
- Arrow functions for concise syntax.
- Template literals for multi-line strings and dynamic expressions.
